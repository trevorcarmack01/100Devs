//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ['Spongebob The Movie', 'Titanic', 'Finding Dory']
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let movieOne = movies[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let arrLength = movies.length
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large 
//and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
